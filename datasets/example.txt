Then you laugh and if you laugh
You lose and let me know in the end of the video if you laughed or if you lose-did *inhale*
Now lets go uh this time were not gonna react to

25 most viewed twitch IRL videos that will be a good time, lets go everybody

Malphite player cuz hes pretty like hes edgy and such"
[woman]: "you dont want to go bot lane with me?"
[man]: "No, cuz you can be the bottom, and Ill be on top."
(smooth af, paco)
*akward umm*
"But yeah... so uh."

Did he just say?
"You can go bottom and I go top," in a MOBA that joke has never ever been said before!

[sarcastically] oh my god
Sometimes social interactions they just go like "woah!" what happened here?
[man in video]: "Besides video games, what are some of your hobbies that you have?"
[Felix]: "You try and change subject right away"
*woman laughs awkwardly*

[Reckful]: "ask the old ladies behind Nani if I could eat their ass... I think thats a little inappropriate..."
[Reckful]: "Nani, they want you to ask the ladies behind you... if you could eat their ass."
[Forsen]: "Hello!... theyre British! will you stop?" *felix laughs*
[Reckful] *surprised* "Oh... they understand?"

"Thank you Tim, we appreciate that."
[2nd str]: "Dont read that...
[2S]: "I knew- I knew better, dude."
*1st realizes*
*Felix laughs*

Ey Mannen.
(Slavic mode ACTIVATE)
Skrattar du,
förlorar du!
MANEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That intro 10/10 - IGN
The rule is simple.
If you laugh,
you will lose. And uhhh...
(Swedish) And believe me, you do NOT want to lose, Man
(Actual Swedish) If you lose you will go out with five whip lashes
Okay
Okay, lets do this!
Have you accepted the challenge?
Very well, lets see if you can beat this challenge.
(upbeat Japanese dance music with singing)
(Pewds embraces inner Japanese)
(Swedish) So far I have not laughed
How did you go?
How did it go for you?
So far, so good.
So far, so good everybody.
- What is it General?
- My Lord, the fleet has moved out of light speed.
- Comm scan has detected an energy field-
Oh, its one of these.
(Chuckle that is definitely not a skrattar.)
- Commscan has detected an energy field protecting i-
(Still totally not a skrattar)
(okay, fine, THATS a skrattar.)
God damn it!
(poods has lost)
God damn it, well done editing that. Thats classic.
Commscan has detected an energy field-
Simpl- simple editing can really make such a huge difference.
Well done, whoever did that one,
youre probably not watching, but Im just saying well done, because I like giving compliments...
Because I am such a... (in swedish) good person, man!
So I had a "relatively small piece" of the company, and what happened is-
Wait a second, you were chairman of the board! You were chairman of the board!
I was chairman, but I didnt run the company. I had nothing to do with running the company
Management was- 
You were paid two million dollars a year.
Excuse me, I didnt run the company, Im just telling you
So what were you paid two million dollars a year for?
(incoming bullshit) Now let me explain- excuse me! Because of my genius, okay.
AYY, hey bazinga!
*Poods Gibberish* Oh! Oh! Oh! why- why did you get paid 2 million dollars Trump...*unintelligible*
*Mumbling and fake crying*
If you get paid two million dollars for doing nothing then yes, you are a genius, I will go as far as say that
(incoming WSJ article about poods supporting Trump.)
Listen to this fucking...
*oof of realization*
Oh my god. Ive become... Edit that out. 
Jesus Christ.
*mock crying* Why did you get paid 2 million dollars meeeh
Look at the look of intensity on My anus (?!)
The question is...Can seven get inside My Anus?!
My Anus is gonna to be careful of a liver kick.
This is not where My Anus wants to be.
My Anus is most comfortable on the ground!
Not a good place for my anus to be...
Myanus loosen- loosen up a little here!
We know, Pat, that My Anus can take a pounding and comeback.
Interesting to see, My Anus getting a little acrobatic.
My anus wants to take him there, take him into the deep water.
So far so good for My anus.
Semmen did say yesterday; He has enormous respect for My anus.
*Pewds falls apart*
This is where My Anus wants to be, Pat!
My Anus didnt quite have the time on the ground that he wanted.
Double jab my Anus.
My anuss movement has been superb here.
MY ANUS IS TAKING P U N I S H M E N T!
ohh... Im such a 12 year old god damn it.
Whats his name? My An- Ain?
(Its "Danny Mainus")
Why would that be his name? My...I understand like Mai,
but is his last name actually Anus?
(no.)
Maybe Anis like Anis, my Anis?
(Almost there...)
You have dickhead parents, no wonder you get into boxing or UFC fighting, whatever its called
I dont know. All I know is I would be able to beat them up, all of them, with these guns, baby.
*swole AF.
Kenan, lets watch some anime
All right, what do we got?
OOOOOOOOOOO! Thats my kind of shit!
*disappointed oh*
Love is like a cock...tail.
Anime really knows how to do romance properly, like I never seen before. I think Ive seen that one, actually.
What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Oh...
- Oh...cards? Oh shit!
- *intelligible* good language first of all
What do you say, we clear up our language...
and try to talk to people in a nice respectful manner?
Is that Chris-chan?
- how about you suck my f- *oof* cock?
Please see the Code of Conduct, you just got reported
for...
*laughter starts*
So what am I supposed to do?
Well man(?) you shouldve learned the game before you joined, huh?
This is called, what? Charades. You know what Charades is about?
I have NO idea.
Hulp...
I cant help.
Dumb-dumbs, go back to the Dumb-Dumb factory.
Is this guy for real?
Buh-bye.
*laughter*
Youre just a baby boy, you dont know any better.
Theres so many big buttons for you to press.
*retarded laugh begins*
*retarded laugh returns*
All those big buttons. Its okay.
Im tickling you.
Where you are the most ticklish?
*retarded laugh doesnt know when to quit*
Maybe right over here?
*Pewds noise of disgust*
Tickle, tickle tickle
*retarded laugh prevails for the fourth time*
Tickle on the nipple.
- Tickle on the ear.
- Tickle on the nipple.
Pewds: tickle on the nipple...
- Youre okay. Tickle on the nipple.
- Oh my god.
- Tickle on the ear.
*crying*
- Oh my fucking god. What the fuck just happend?
Thats so creepy! fucking weirdos... Was that Chris Chan? Can someone confirm? My god. Well, I definitely lost.
(Spaghetti?)

(Wait...whats that?)
(The fuck...)

(Please...)
(Fuck that shit.)
UUUWAAAAAAAAAARRRHHHHHHHH

Dont ruin Bolognese for me, please why would you did?
UUUWAAAAAAAAAARRRHHHHH
Come on man! Come on man! Thats not cool, man!
Wait, you what?

Oh!

Never give up!
This is the new Just do it! guy... Japanese Shia LaBeouf. Never give up!
Never give up! Let me see if I can do it.
 What are you doing? Never give up!
Is that my phone? Do you know how fucking annoying it is? Can people just leave me alone...all the time?
*Its Brules Rules with Dr. Steve Brule* Oh no, Ive seen this one.
Im Dr. Steve Brule will focus on genders, some people are boys and really want to be girls, some girls wanna be boys
Just be happy with your vagina...

Dont have to make a new one, and if you got a penis just keep it on, dont cut it off!
yOu goT iT aLReadY, dOnT cUt iT oFf!1!
You got! This is... This is a bathtub!
(Russian Dub) Is Scott home?
Eehhh... The thing is
(approximately) Fucking hell! Fuuuuuuck!
*epic slav dance music*
Yes! These editing...are so good. Thats like five different clips.
Okay four.
(its actually five)
Cyka Blyat! Skrattar du förlorar du, thats what that means (no it isnt).
*Weird ass laughter*
Okay!
*More weird ass laughter*
Some of them might, you just dont understand. I dont understand what you want from me.
"Lets face it the new YouTube sucks.
Its just not as good as what it used to be."
Yes! The Unregistered Hypercam 2! Yeah, this.
*memories of 2009 YouTube intensify*
So true.
*nasally voice* Oh, the new YouTube sucks. Now you have to censor...were fucking swear word.
To be honest, yes, YouTube does suck and the Adpocalypse hit me pretty hard. Its terrible. I dont know what to do with  myself.
Im gonna have to open a Patreon. Its getting real desperate :(((
*Inhales*
*Homestuck music*
Why would you like, a fucking character from Splatoon. Like what kind of pathetic, waifus that?
Wait a minute.
Oh! No no no no no.
Aspetta (wait a second).
I cannot have this video in the video, because YouTube will then say "no, no money for you Felix"
And Im like, but its just an edgy joke about
Suicide. Nothing wrong with suic- no. Im gonna move on to the next video now. Skrattar du, förlorar du
dont forget...Yeah, this fucking clip from Star Wars! Why was that in the film?
Oh my go-arhha!
And its green, everyone is like, its a reference to the first Star Wars, where he has blue milk.
Well, then why the hell is it green milk, and why does he drink it? Its not funny. Its gross. Like, if youre a walrus...
I-If you wanna milk a walrus, fine.
Milk a walrus, you know? First of all, not to be all vegan all preachy and shit, but milk is disgusting, its repulsive.
Youre drinking titty milk, okay?
Maybe this is, like, a commentary on the fact that how disgusting that is. All the hormones based for
calfs to grow strong. Youre drinking that shit, no wonder youre growing man boobs...like a fucking weirdo. Fine! Okay, fine!
You know what, milk is fine, okay?
Lets just put that on the radar cuz I dont care...
But you have a creature that sits up like a human being. It sits up like this...
you dont see my crotch region now, but just imagine that theres four titties here and someone just sticks a can there and
Its just disgusting, its repulsive. Its double layers. Theres too many layers, and the reference thing doesnt work.
Have you like skrattat yet or not? Great.
People keep posting this one. Look at this guys. "Dank.webm"
🎵 Pour some sugar on- 🎵
Oh my god, it was salt instead of sugar, because if you pour sugar on yourself...
it doesnt hurt, but salt really hurts. That is so dank. Oh my gah!
That is hilarious. Oh my god. It was salt
I mixed up the salt and the sugar. Oh my- how could anyone do that? Oh my god!
Why am I criticizing jokes? Im the unfunniest youtuber on this website.
-Lets talk about your options
-Okay.
- Kel?
- Yes?
- Focus.
- I am. Like, Im listening to what youre saying, but I only hear what I want to.
- Thats just called being a woman.
Ooh! Thug Life! Haha,
youre a wahmen.
Hes not respecting the wahmen, all right, okay? Thats an outdated meme as well.
Everything is just not funny. Nothing is funny.
Well that was funny clearly. God damn it!
So stupid XD
CYKA BLYAT
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
Well that was, amazing, thank you. Thank you for that one, that was great. Thank you.
uuuuuugh
Okay, we finished the whole thread. Fantastic. Thats two threads of garbage.
omae wa mou
shindeiru
NANI
*universe exploding holy shit*
People are memeing Star Wars even the movies not out yet.
(japanese meme)

Thank you for leaving a like, lets get this one...

YLYL 0056

Article 13 has passed, everyone.
What we feared all along, has become a reality.
The internet as we know it, is gone.
It's obviously really upsetting.
I think a lot of people don't know what's gonna happen.
But people have been saying things like:
"Now memes will be banned."
"Now all this content from Europe will be banned."
YouTube have been saying that they might remove content completely from EU.
It's obviously a big change coming.
And that's why I have a great deal for you guys.
Honestly, we didn't know that article 13 was gonna pass but I've teamed up with Nord VPN which is an amazing VPN.
I use it myself.
Article 13: gets passed
My VPN: This is America.
That's right, there's a simple solution to all this Article 13 mumbo jumbo.
VPNs, baby.
In case you don't know, a VPN lets you browse the internet as if you were anywhere - almost anywhere in the World.
Jokes on you, European legislation. I don't understand.
So, Nord VPN. It's a great service. You can even use it  on your phone. It's super simple to use.
And right now, we have a great deal, that you don't get just 50% off.
You don't get 100% off.
You get 75% off if you entered the code, ¨PewDiePie¨
nordvpn.com/pewdiepie
It's only $2.99 (£2.29) a month.
That's a great price. I mean, honestly that is pretty cheap.
And you get one month for free because you entered the code, "PewDiePie"
So, good for you.
What a way to troll the European Union.
*chuckles*
There's obviously other reasons to use a VPN especially for security reasons.
What? You don't care about internet security?
Pfft! What a loser.
Pathetic, okay.
You need to care about these things, you know?
All your data could easily be stolen.
*snaps fingers*
Just like that.
If you have a VPN, it's protected. It's protection.
Thank You, Nord VPN for sponsoring this video and now let's get on with it.
*mimicking gunfire sounds*
Skrrrrra.
*pop noise followed by an exhaled "aah" sigh*
*mimicking car swerving noises*
Skrattar du. (Swedish: You laugh.)
Welcome, all new subscribers.
Ever since this T-Series vs PewDiePie thing.
My channel has just been abundantly inflated with subscribers.
But really, this is it.
*breathy chuckling*
It's just me in a bedroom looking at stuff on the internet.
I want that to be clear here. I don't want there to be any higher expectations. This is all that we're doing.
We're gonna go, "Haha!" over a bunch of clips today.
Now, since we have so many new subscribers, I decided to create this new show called, "You Laugh, You Lose"
We're testing this out. Please be patient. We'll see how it goes.
But basically, the rule is simple: you laugh, you lose.
Let's freaking go.
Hey look, it's me. It starts with me.
T-Series.
35 years
How long does trash live? A thousand years!
We don't need to cry anymore, we are winning.
That's right, everyone.
I don't know if we still are.
It's ironic how we made the "Congratulation" song to wrap up the meme - to stop the meme.
Oh God. *laughs and loses*
Oh, they're playing "Congratulations" now.
*sniffles* Great.
We finally did it.
We persuaded nine-year-olds from saying, "T-Gay" to "Congratulations" instead, amazing.
Well done. Comeback of the goddamn century. We'll go for another thousand years - another millennium, easy!
*Billy chuckling*
*laughs*
*PewDiePie doing a Jojo stand cry*
Oh.
Mandy: ("Your next line is..." in Japanese)
PewDiePie: Yes!
Mandy: "Buenos días, Mandy."
("Good morning, Mandy." in Spanish)
Billy: Buenos días, Mandy.
PewDiePie: What?
Billy: ("What!?" in Japanese)
No. Nooo. Noo. No- *laughs*
*Billy screaming in pain*
*explosion noise*
I- *sighs*
Jesus Christ.
I still haven't watched Jojo but I feel like with all the memes it will just never live up to the expectation.
"low quality yet high tier"
Oh, it's another one of these, huh?
Who will it-
Oh! Dr. Phil? Dr. Phil, kawaii desu ne. Sugoi. Ii desu yo. ("He is cute. Amazing! It is good!" in Japanese)
Dr. Phil-san. He's so beautiful. Absolute beautiful man. I miss him.
You know, I miss seeing him. I miss making videos of him. I wake up sometimes at night, wet, thinking about Dr. Phil
Man: Wow.
Man: Well, guess I'm gonna sow it myself.
Man: The heck?
Man: Mama! What's going on h-
*laughs*
That's funny.
Do people buy those cookies and just to put their shit in?
Then why are they so convenient to use for sewing stuff? Pathetic!
What is happening here? What is this?
Person recording: Oh no.
Oh. It's beautiful.
*cello continues to play*
See? All these life skills that parents try and emit upon their children -
that is never gonna give them anything in life beyond just random memes. I really appreciate that.
*laughs*
You know this kid had to go to like thousands of dollars of lessons -
just lead up to this moment.
I mean, I'm sure it's not that hard to play but still.
*cello plays*
No kid wakes up one day like I want to play that big weird guitar looking instrument.
Cello? Is that what it's called? No, it isn't. Shut up. I know what it's called.
"never touch jimmy fallon's hand"
Jimmy Fallon: You at one point-
PewDiePie: Okay.
Jimmy Fallon: played the piano laying upside down.
Jimmy Fallon: You were laying on the ground playing with your hands crossed.
Rami Malek: Yeah.
Jimmy Fallon: You were laying on the ground playing with your hands crossed.
Jimmy Fallon: You were laying on the ground playing with your hands crossed.
Rami Malek: Spoiler alert.
PewDiePie: What's gonna happen here?
Jimmy Fallon: Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah.
*audience laughter*
Rami Malek: Please. Stop.
Jimmy Fallon: Please, there's other ones.
Rami Malek: No, no, no.
PewDiePie: Oh.
Rami Malek: That was something Freddie did-
*laughs*
What happened?
Jimmy Fallon: At one point played the piano laying upside down you were laying on the ground playing with your hands crossed.
Rami Malek: Yeah.
Jimmy Fallon: At one point played the piano laying upside down you were laying on the ground playing with your hands crossed.
Jimmy Fallon: At one point played the piano laying upside down you were laying on the ground playing with your hands crossed.
Rami Malek: Spoiler alert.
Jimmy Fallon: Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah.
*audience laughter*
Rami Malek: Please. Stop.
Jimmy Fallon: Please, there's other ones.
Rami Malek: No, no, no.
Rami Malek: That was something Freddie did-
Jimmy always laughs. What happened, Jimmy?
Why was that not funny?
"Looks like he just got his whole life ruined"
"Another three months of heavy drinking and memory wipe therapy gone.
So he has a second emotion besides laughter.
Who would have thought? See that's the most surprising, I just assumed that he just laughs.
I've never seen another emotion from this man.
Oh my God. 'Ey, it's this one.
Oh, that's creepy.
Doctor Phil, no!
Spider-Man: What the f***?
Oh, it's based on "Us". Okay, okay. I got it. Okay. That's funny. I still haven't seen that movie.
Ah, that actually makes a lot of sense now. Now it's a joke.
Woman: Logan, tell me you did not just hit him.
Woman: Lucas, did Logan hit you?
Lucas: Yes! He hit-
Woman: Really?
Logan: He ate my f***ing waffle!
Oh, Jesus!
Logan, what a savage.
Is this Logan and Jake Paul?
Logan: He ate my f***ing waffle!
"Don't take a mans waffle"
Wait, Logan took his waffle?
Oh, well that changes it.
Woman: Lucas, did Logan hit you?
Lucas: Yes! He hit-
Woman: Really?
Logan: He ate my f***ing waffle!
He ate his waffle.
That's totally justified then.
Don't eat Logan's waffle. Everyone knows this.

Goddamn Sans meme in 2019.
Jesus Christ.
When will you kids learn?
Some triggered Nintendo Switch user going around saying that you take
a Xbox controller and a PlayStation controller
and hook them into the memory card slots of an old Nintendo Wii
PewDiePie: What happens then?
and then you take an external DVD Drive
PewDiePie: Okay.
and hook that into the-
USB in the back
along with a floppy disk drive
PewDiePie: A floppy disk drive?
and then you take this adapter right here.
PewDiePie: Uh-huh.
and then you attach it to the extra USB cord on the back of it.
PewDiePie: Uh-huh.
Then you can hook this flash card reader-
PewDiePie: A flash card reader. Yes.
Connect an additional USB to the second port.
Then plug that into a Bluetooth headset and attach a wall adapter to this one right here.
Then plug it into a pumpkin nutmeg pie candle
PewDiePie: And then you can play Tuber Simulator.
Insert a spare GameCube memory card into-
PewDiePie: No? Okay.
this chip reader.
Then punch in
PewDiePie: That did not do anything!
"up, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, B, A" and allowed to type, "car Wii remote"
Now let's see if it worked.
PewDiePie: Oh my God!
I knew it.
Mum, we're buying an Xbox controller and a Wii!
My mum is not even here.
I don't know why I said that.
Unbelievable.
Oh god. Yes. Have I seen this?
"Resident Evil 2 but 1000% facial animations"
Okay, 200%
What the hell is that?
Ew.
Oh, it's a burger.
That's not too bad.
Wait, I'm cutting to the good stuff.
300%
That's how I eat.
All right, all right, all right. 1000%, let's go.
That's a tasty burger, right there.
Uh, it's not too bad- Oh!
The burger just that good...
that your whole face melts.
Hey, look, it's another PewDiePie. The only stuff that makes me laugh.
Boy: Mum, are you subscribed to PewDiePie?
Mother: No.
Boy: I'm going to live with dad.
Good, as you should. Get your mum and make her to subscribe, right fricking now. I'm waiting.
Hi, mum! Subscribe, please.
Thanks!
Did that work?
Incredible.
Almost all 9 year olds have a mum, right?
If we can get all the 9 year olds mums to subscribe.
Then we have doubles subscribers.
Alright, that was it for this week's "You Laugh, You Lose"
Smash like if you laughed and smash like if you lose and I see you broskis tomorrow.

Can you beat this?
Extremely difficult challenge. I think not! If you laugh
You lose
Which is why every time I finish these fucking videos I go "Did you laugh or did you lose?"
Its the same fucking thing you idiot piece of shit, Pewdiepie Jesus Christ
Anyway, lets begin.
Another laugh, you lose episode 5 Sou.. 5 [When you try your best but you dont succeed]
Episode 5. This is episode 5.
Ok, here we go!
What an anime is this?
When you get the fan subs. (laughs)
Did I already..? No, it doesnt count! What anime is this? Is that Bakuman?
Used to read that shit man. They finished it. Oh hell. Yeah, man shut up, okay?
You keep going lets keep going! The fuck is this? Mario Party?
Some of these are just so painfully unfunny like who thinks this is funny
How can you think thats funny Are you f-- are you f-f-fucking retarded man?
oh, hes spinning. you spin my head right round, Heh heh heh aheh heh
What da fak pastor, Dr.. Marcus good morning. Everyone. My name is Pastor, Dr. Martian Samba.
Senpai!? Capacity as the Chairman of the national task force against homosexuality in Uganda
Is he against homosexuality? What why? Barack Obama back off (old man laugh)
(Alien Noise)
Excuse me Barack Obama could you please back up? Thank you Kindly sir, please?
Step back, step back back
Ive taken time for a little research to kno-. Hes taking time to do a little research
Lets see what he found.
What homosexuals do in the privacy of their bedroom. One of the thing they do is called "anal licking" where a mans anus.
Is licked (Making an licking noise) like this.
...by the other person
Like ice cream. Like ice cream? (not laughing)
I didnt laugh
And even poopoo comes out the other poopoo is out and then they eat the poopoo
The other one they do is they have a sex practice called "fisting"
Where they insert their hand into the other mans hand and it goes into the anus all the way
He insert his hand in his other mans hand
I dont see any wrong with that at all
As Africans we want to ask Barack Obama to explain to us is this what he wants to bring to Africa?
As a Human right to eat the poopoo!
To eat the poopoo they eat the poopoo!
Can you believe this? Its funny and all but its also just blatant clearly homophobia of like making all these crazy
All those gay people you know what they do. They take the shit and they smear it all over their face
Oh, they love shit. Its disgusting we need to sit, like...

He brings that

Five hundred million dollars for cancer research, thats what that lie did. yeah
Look at my line thomson everybody had the fans on remember the brand sure I fucking loved pillsbury dough gets out the sun yay
You know it wasnt built on cancer. Yeah
The whole thing was annoying and I hate how oprah was interviewing them and acting like she was
Dumbfounded that this guy would do this like shes been in show business for 35 years and she cant like wrap her head around
some guy doing
Whatever it takes to get to the next level didnt she for the first five years have like midgets who wanted to bang the Mailmans
Boyfriend and she didnt want to do it. What wait
oh brad midgets what can I not find anything about the goddamn maid yet look the guy was the
sociopath on a bicycle all right
Both concern we got off easy. Yeah, if that guy was working for a corporation
He probably would have been porn stuff in the water supply doing god-knows-what
Just keep them on the bike
hes not hurting anybody, not hurt anybody and
The top 20 guys like all tested positive yes, roy, so Im so true. Yeah beat you all right it up guys
Okay
Run that filthy sport. Its all ours absolutely ridiculous
He doesnt represent
Cycling are they going to return all the money that they make a guys ass theyre going to turn in their yachts. Theyre not gonna
Not going to show everyone turn in your yacht
Its so true as soon as someone is something has them someone else. Uh its a terrible. Were not going to do anything
You know, but this is terrible. Were be closing an eye for it, but this is terrible
Man Bill bird talking about one punch man. Its so funny
And its so spot-on like I tweeted that I like this show called one punch man
alright and
The fucking responses that I got I got dude you fucking drunk. Oh my gosh
Youre in the anime, and then other people just like this is like the greatest day
The monsters that he fights you also get more of an insight into where peoples heads Iraq
You know one of the months is he fought with some giant virus
sent here by the Earth to get rid of the all the humans because of what weve done to the planet so theres
Environmental thing then my favorite one was this guy who was crab man
He was half
Like up top and he was all a crab and then the bottom he was he was half a guy and he was in
The bottom half. Hes in his bare feet and tighty whities
and
the guys like oh
I ate so much crab meat that I became a fucking crab and to me he represented the upper 1% corporate guys
You know on some power lunch just eating all the fucking sushi and just take take take take take nothing spiritual about him
So he gave him the old right there fred and then he fought this fuckin left
And she command of all the mosquitos
And she spit the mosquitoes on everybody suck all the blood out of you and all your fucking energy
And then it would make her stronger and to me its like. Oh, this is a gold-digging blood sucking whore ha ha
Its funny how he sees the show so differently like I didnt look. Its one punch fucking man
I wouldnt even think about looking into the meaning behind all the enemies and people he care
I just love how he fucking breaks it down so brilliantly and he doesnt even watch anime. Its fucking hilarious
Gobert is a goddamn genius

As many as I goddamn please. Lets get this party started
Lets get this party started
Ear Rape 2.0
A Classic example of a loud equals funny
Made a loud Noise! AhAHAH!
Two Shots of Vodka

Know which any one of them. Oh good. Hell yeah, Im feeling this one. Oh damn schools. Got some pretty good taste Phantasy Star Online
Terraria Tekken
Okay, how do you even drop a juggle like that youre a ghost bound to a room with nothing to do all day
But eat pudding and play video games, and you drop an air juggle after three fucking hits no
Im not even gonna give you that it was two quick jabs and a bounce and you dropped at the bounce wouldnt have even kept
The combo going you wouldve just slam Nina into the ground right after to light jabs to piss-poor
Damage kasnia is built specifically for juggles and you uppercut jab jab into a fucking bounce juggle starter
And what is this a mid gut punch into a back?
Shes rolling around on the ground, or you just mash you square and triangle you
Okay that was good
Well done I dont know where thats from but well done. To be honest
I was really looking forward to watch this anime and now I dont know how to feel
Uh-oh, that sounds like Swiper the Fox that sneaky Fox is always trying to swipe our stuff

Thank you surveillance come on. Dude. Youre cancer you are cancer
Answer what? How the fuck did we get out this far?
Shit no more gas.
Oh, this guys a legend shit no more gas no hey
Ah that was good good one, okay?
How to make a triple a game, its I think theres one is they trying to say
Hey you want the whole game you gotta get the season pass man come on man, dont be silly

Masterpiece well that was pretty thats pretty accurate
I would say well done do I look like I know what a JPEG is?
Was close that one was close, I give you that one well then do I look like I know what a JPEG news

oh, okay, that`s cool
Ohoh NO
I need to play that game again, god
dammit, the gifts from it is amazing, of the weapons
"so, as you can imagine medieval castles were NOT
easy to break into
they were basically like those jungle gym things
at chuck-e-cheese`s. massive in
size, intentionally confusing layout
security everywhere
and by the end of your visit, you`ll probably end up
with some kind of disease, so in order to
help penetrate fortresses
medieval armies would often utilize siege weapons one of
the most popular of which was the trebuchet. now this
device is interesting enough on it`s own but it gets better
so around 1300 AD
THE FUCK IS THIS
scotland however one fortress
known as stirling castle was giving him all lot of trouble
he laid siege to the building for many months
without any real progress. then one day he woke up and
had a revelation:hey guys, listen
why are we wasting our time
building all these regular sized trebuchets when we could just build
one giant one and call it a day. so that`s what he did
this gargantuan war machine
was known as the warwolf and stood
at around six stories tall. to get a bit of perspective
this is about as tall as king kong was in his largest filmed depiction
so basically our picture
launching bolders like they`re baseballs and you`ve got a pretty good
idea of what the warwolf was capable
of he was so intimidating that when the scots saw the
the english constructing the beast outside the castle. they
immediately surrendered out of fear, but then edward was like :
fuck that, I`m gonna test this
bad boy out and proceeded to take potshots on the castle anyway
that`s fucking awesome. see, we need- this is the stuff
we need, happening, there`s too many
passive aggressive people on social media
because no one`s out killing each other
how to make a blockbaster

Together we can do it. Together, we are strong. DO NOT skrattar.  Im looking at you.
*whispers* How you doin babe? *fake croud laughing*
(the sports narrator narrates the sport in german)
Oh great
*loud voice over the sport narrator* SIX - NINE
*pewd quietly chuckles* (sports narrator still speaking german)
Why is this a meme like I see it everywhere.
Its not even- *laughing*
Alright! I gotta find the original.
Hes like in a pool with an egg here...
(music: Low from Flo Rida can be heard)
Wait, is it real?
Wait, is it real? *chuckles (looks uncertain)*
Wheres the original? Im try-, cuz hes in a- hes a swimming pool.

(same song, high pitched) (jeans,  boots with the FUR, the FUR...
*pewds humming/singing* now the whole clubs looking at her...
*not singing, talking*  Nothing like a good old jacuzzi bath with your fellow AK.
*stars laughing and in high pitched voice* ha, he looks so dumb!
*genuine laughs*
Oh my god, I got a do, I got a do a video on my boy, my boy.
*says something inaudible*
*hold music, soft music*
(music ended abruptly.  Theres a sound of movement then silence again)
Hey six - nine
(buzzer sound) six - nine (cocking gun sound)
(song: Education Connection Commercial Jingle)
This- *stops music* This meme really took off, huh ?
*sing-song tone* Who posted it first? thats right everybody I get extra meme points!
👏👏👏
I really would love to see some sort of meme currency.
If anyone can please invent a meme currency that puts a new- any meme...
Its like a stock, right? And you can invest in the meme stock. This, I know this is a billion dollar idea.
Cuz this is a rebound meme. Like this is an older meme coming back.
So lets say you had invested in this meme and then it takes off *👌clicks fingers* BAM
Millionaires.
(still the same jingle music)
(...matched me with the right college for fr-)
(F-R-E-E. that spells cr*ditr*port.com baby...)
(the interrupting song: credit report . com baby)
*softly* I dont know. I dont like this meme. Sorry.
(thats a good painting you got there...)
(...too bad its the wroong one.)
*unimpressed* I got it. Its obunga.
(This is the right painting! Youve got the wrong painting!)
(I dont know; they look exactly alike!)
(SILENCE fools!) *pewds laughing*
(Its gone long enough. This painting clearly (???)...)
(...and it must be destroyed.) *pews laughs at that* (No!no destroying that painting. Thats a piece of history
(No! No destroying that painting. Thats a piece of history.)
(Come on, I painted this.)
(WHAT?)
Oh no, why am I in there?
*they are litteraly ALL screaming*
(buzzer)
(All the Meeseeks from Rick and Morty keeps repeating him or that one there. He wrote me into this!)
And, there can only be E okay?
There can only be E or B actually...now that I think about it.
You know what? Ignore me!
(Imagine)
*laughs*
Every fortnight thumbnail ever.
(FBI coming in!) (guy screams)
(Yep)
(This is  a bucket) *laughs*
No... not the bucket. Oh my god, so random! Whenever its random, I just cant help myself.
Every (guy screaming) isnt it?
( U - R - M - R - G - A - Y...)
(If you look closer it will read you are Mr-)
(the only thing my mom used  to ever tell me was dont let people (distorted)grab my PlAyStAtI0n))
(People will find a way)  (No!!)
*chuckling*
God DAMMIT! Are you having fun watching this blank face then occasionally letting out a ha ha?
I hope youre being entertained as much as I am.
Come on! Give me something good. Come on!
(...one goal...To wipe out half the universe.)
(If he gets all the Infinity stones...)
((its the Avengers Infinity War trailer by the way))
(Tell me his name again.)
(BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!)
I dont know. Theyre creative but theyre not funny, okay.?
Hes gonna grab an ak...
Oh there he is again! The 6-9-9 memes everybody. God dammit *laughs*
I dont even know why I laughed. Okay, and I actually didnt laugh. Hey...
I didnt laugh. *cocks gun* (buzzer)
Hey, its a painting memeeverybody. Its gonna be obunga!
I guarantee you. There he is!
So beautiful. Oh my gAAAAAAAAA *laughs*
I would love to see a meme that is
just random memes that pretends that their memes from the future, because literally anything is just a meme these days.
You cant- you cant appoint us something be like no, thats ridiculous that can never be a meme. Literally anything can be a meme.
Which is the beauty of meme everybody.
(suspect is flying on foot)
Of course! Of course.
(Wake up lieutenant Connors slap scene from veidogame Detroit Become Human = really loud edit)
(Its me! Connor.)
I need to play that stupid game. But AM I GONNA? ha ha
(trumpetman saying unimportant bullshit...which is already written on screen)
*pewds chuckles at this nonsensical speech*
I swear trump just read Starship Troopers and be like, yeah. Yep. Its time.
(-to be the best pirate I have ever seen.)
(so it will seem.)
pirate! uh-
*laughs*
(the Pirate of the Caribbean music really covers what theyre saying)
(PAY FOR MUS-)  You cut before the best bit! the holbushshh, the hhijolsgdjvihrddllo (gibberish)
*laughing*
(What did I do??)
(You know its illegal to download copyrighted music! Im taking you in!)
(girl screams loudly)
I guess hes not that great of a pirate.
Hey, *cocks gun* Never illegally download!      (now concentrate)
Hey, its another painting meme.
What is it going to be?
What are they gonna do? What they gonna do? What are they (gibberish) obunga. Obunga.
I got my bets on obunga.
Come on...come on.
My man, my man, come on. Come on fifty bucks!
Fifty bucks. Fifty bucks on obunga.
Five hundred. Five hundred thousand. Five millions. Obunga.
My man, - DAMN IT!! *laughs*
(Oh my god)
(song: Intro from Blend S anime)
SKRATTA DU. FÖLORA DU! MANNEEEEE...
*pewds immediatly laughed* yes!  oooooh (russian music in background)
(weeb song: Endless Tears - Maiko Nakamura ft. Cliff Edge... just look at pewds face!) Yea!
(Ive been watching gdq for two years now and today I just found out that my grandpa died two hours ago crowd applauses.
That was amazing. (sarcasm)
*chuckles*
Theres nothing funny about dying in Mario Kart.
(same Japanese song as just before)
(IF your name is Junior aaand youre really handsome, coooome on raise your haaand)
Alright, I dont even know what to say. That was fantastic. Well done. All the links in the description everybody.
Did you skratta? Did you fölora? Let me know in the comments.
Leave a like if you skratta. Leave a like if you fölora. And as always...
(just a slight ringing...)
(nice soft percussions type of music)
(now its chord instrument? the pitch goes downwards starting from higher pitched)
(really arcade game kind of music, neutral but sets the ambiance)
(weird twirling sound...a kind of flute? its like someone washing a window!)
(violins, classical music since boss is defeated; a happy/light higher tone)
Personal note: please take subtitles seriously. It is suppose to depict at least the sounds/talking going on. Some people need them.
Also, Pewdiepie said previously that Animal Super Squad (ASS) is out on all consoles.

Welcome to skrattar du, förlorar du
Mannen.  You laUgH, you loSe, YouTubes “greatest” show, everybody.
I wonder how many copystrikes this one will get hmmMMm, keep watching and you will find out
Usually, I just get the clips from 4chan, but I genuinely think Ive seen every single "You laugh,
you lose."  Congrats to me, ( yay ! ) everybody. So, were trying something different today.
Im re— ( .-. )Im reacting to meme compilation clips, and well see if they make me skratta or not.
bRinG iT
Wah pedals have a very famous and recognizable sound.  WA . It, it made a WA sound because of WA-Luigi. I am laughing ( hahahahaha end me )
internally because 
WOooooOooo
Its a close one. ( not really ;-; ) WOw. Uh, it set the standard high here. Lets see some more clips. It looks like we have Harry Potter moving on
Whats that? ( your mom. )
(wE hAve uPdAteD oUr PrIvacY poLICy nOoOooOo D: )
When was this uploaded, huh? What is this old ass memes? ( old as fossils.. )
This was uploaded yesterday. Lord KEK?  More like Lord ... Whack.  Goddammit. Now, concentrate
on how it makes you feel and let your hand drift across the canvass ( what one oF canvas?  (; )
I cant believe I never played this game.( Are you serious, omfg ) I played literally every single game from, uh, or is it David Cage?
F***ing weirdo. All right. It will be, what, a minion? Shrek? ( sOmE bOdy oNce tOld mE thE wORld- )
(FATHER ZUCC)
(chuckles)
Oh my God... ( omg in deed. )
(chuckles) Okay, fine fine, you ma--you made me chuckle. It wasnt a skratta, it was a tch
Moving on! Have you skrattad yet? Leave a like if you havent. Hit the bell button for more funny videos just like this one ( yes. Very funny man (: )
...has installed a new 18-foot long neon sign along the Route-66 corridor. You cant miss it ( So it’s long and I’m guessing pretty hard (; )
Its right next to the Tower Theater. Once its turned on, the sign will spell out Deli-Cat-Essen. ( Is that a porn place? )
What?  What? ( Confused 0.0)
Delicatessen
That is--I thought that was a Swedish word. You cant miss it
Its right next to the Tower Theater. Once its turned on, the sign will spell out Deli-Cat-Essen. ( pORn. YEs oR nAh )
(laff) I dont get it. Deli-Cat. I need to scroll down to see if anyone can explain this joke to me. I dont get it ( Me neither ;-; )
With the glass ceiling broken, all the oppressed groups shall prosper, especially the most oppressed group of all. Gamers (OH MA GAH EXCUSE ME YOU CUNT )
What am I supposed to say, huh? Am I supposed to say, "No, Gamers arent oppressed?" ( They are. I’m one. )Because that would be a lie
Theres been no group, beyond gamers, that has been abused,
mistreated. Just look at Battlefield 5, just look at Assassins Creed ( ooooof )
How DARE they have a woman in an Assassins Creed game, tch,  I know. Women cant ( I am a woman and I agree ]:< )
...  rUn. ( Only walk or waddle. ) where am I going with this joke? Thats a great quest--hey, Grandayy!

Well done, Grandayy, you did it! (skratta)
I didnt expect that. That was good meme, good meme. Gary, you need to massage (omigod )
You need to massage the testicles, the baby oil and you put it in and out. Uh-oh.( When a woman and a man love each other very much- )
Look at him. Look at this guy, Hes like:
Oh, yeah ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ( Me as well )
And you put it in and out. Uh-oh.
Oh, yeah. Tell me more.
You put the put p--penis to warm it. In, in, in the cold winter, you warm. This seems like one of those interviews that is faked ( like most of my life ;-; )
You know, they edit it to make it more awkward, but instead its the opposite ( I think one guy is having a fucking anyorism )
Yeah. Make sure all the blood flow
(weird grunt noises....or is it?)
Or maybe it is. Category - pets and animals (wait what) moving on
All I want is a Black Lotus. Here we go
A Black Lotus?
Black Lotus live on the stream
( he gonna pull out a random piece of shit and be like HOLY FUCK BABY JESUS )
IT IS!?  LOOK!  IT IS! ITS A BLACK LOTUS!! ( Looks like a hot wheels toy...)
 
ITS A 2014 LOTUS
(Pewds laughing while a guy is dying inside) ( I’m dying as well brother )
Thats amazing, live on camera. I thought they didnt have many more of the original magic gatherings, It always amazes me
how adult people can still be interested in Pokemon cards. Pathetic. ( You’re making a YouTube video. YOURE 28 ) Heavily played, its, uh, completely destroyed
Wait, Solid Snake is in smash? Has he always been? ( Idk. )
(Chuckles) Library Cop from Seinfeld. ( O yes )
Wait, he was racist in that? ( fuck yea man. )
Oh, hell yeah. ( he looking like a snacc )
(    E    ) Oh my God, goddammit ( YOU CANNOT ESCAPE )
Its gonna pause the other video.
(laughs)
Great. What alphabet letter are--is going to become a meme next, guys? Place your bets down in the description
Im thinking a ℚ cause its a bit weird one, isnt it? ( FUCKING F MAN )
Girl, look how orange you (BLEEP) look, girl
( CHARLIE THE PUMPKIN. looking like before and after pictures. ) (chuckles) Goddammit! Theyre too quick. You cant just move on to Maui or whatever, Mona, whatever.
What? What? No. Im here... ( My face when something really cringe happens but I still wanna see what it is )
You now have (  E  )
You see what I mean?
I need to process what I just watched. And now theres some FIFA dude in front of me. Lord KEK,
very disappointed in this compilation. So lets check it out live right now
( Fucking awesome skills bro. Kill it man )
Sorry, Dolan, I already made this meme. Goodbye. What does life look like during your period?
Whatss wrong, baby? Its up to... ( You’re face! D: )
(laugh)
Fine, Lord KEK, I will give you (chuckles) a pass
And heres Rhonda Merkin. She and some girlfriends invented a rug recycling machine called the Carpet Muncher."

Literally just doesnt seem like theyre really
Paying attention to what theyre doing I know its like it doesnt matter what their message is because theyre just doing
Something else you never feel that way
Something I cant even remember what I stand ready for beside the worst member in the planet apparently um oh my god
She has the worst memory on the planet
That is crazy
Right here, we are watching the worst memory of the planet person. Thats crazy. Thats crazy
I prefer
My underwear like fall under the doorway which is weird

This is painful
Remember what the heck was she smoking because whatever it was I gotta get her to quit fast
Pewds: Dont look at it

The shield protects the fall of course oh yes

That man sure knows how to use a ladder man dumb. What are you bro? I got to find the source to this
He burned my patch. Oh, this is old. Oh the person recording shoots
The kid because the kid had made a video of himself burning his old team patch
But the guy recording who was on the team of the hoos patch was burned happened to recognize him the actions of the persons were
Absolutely ridiculous and puts bad name to airsoft a little criticism and a burnt patch doesnt justify something like this aah fair enough
He just forgot to disable friendly fire

Oh, God!

(players laugh) FELIX: Oh, God.

He becomes a stripper, very nice!
Good meme! Good old classic... man, I need to do more videos with VR, theyre so funny.

MAN: You there! Stop where you are. Stay on the rocks! Dont step on the sand, it makes the ant lions crazy!
FELIX: I dont think you can save... oh. (laughs)
MAN: Stop it, Freeman!
FELIX: Freeman, please.
MAN: No! Please... no. No! Noo! Nooooo!
FELIX: Naw, thats what Im saying, he dies anyway. It doesnt matter. Stop crying, its okay, its a video game. its a video game!
God, ants arent real! Jesus Christ...
MAN: Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive!
...and its strong enough to pick up pancake!
FELIX: Oh my God. (laughs)
Goddammit!

MAN: ...wet food, pet hair, or Thai sticky rice. It even sweeps slippery ice.
FELIX: Ice?!
MAN: Its so light, I can pick up a mess using my pinky!
FELIX: Wow, with your pinky!
MAN: The Hurricane Spin Room is whisper quiet, and...
FELIX: Can I pick up my dog?
MAN: ...swivels around furniture quick and easy, with no cords and no batteries.
FELIX: BATTERIES!!
MAN: The secret is triple-brush technology that uses centrifugal...
FELIX: Watch, it can pick up everything!
MAN: ...force, combined with a rotating action to sweep up everything in its path.
FELIX: Holy frick, dude!
MAN: Just push to empty in the trash...
FELIX: Im freaking out over here!
MAN: ...your hands never touch the mess. And the Spin Broom has a mega-mouth, thats big enough...
FELIX: MEGA MOUTH!!
MAN: ...to pick up a ham sandwich! Look at that!
FELIX: HAM SANDWICH!! (laughs)
MAN: The giant corner brushes clean along baseboards and toe kicks with...
MAN: Even vinyl! It gets into the grout lines, leaving nothing behind. And the fold-flat handle...
FELIX: What about the pancakes?
MAN: ...lets you easily reach...
FELIX: What about the pancakes?!
MAN: ...between and under furniture. And its strong enough to pick up pancake!
FELIX: (laughing uncontrollably) "Honey, I dropped a couple of large batteries, get the spin broom!"
I think its safe to say I lost, I definitely lost.
Please, Brad ~sama. Please. Can I get another life?
Oh, thank you, kind sir.
Looks like Im still in the game! Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha (old man laugh)
MAN: 7 + 6 is 12, or 7 + 6 are 12?
7 + 6 is 12.
Well, it all depends on how you look at it, because from another perspective, its 12, and from another perspective are 12.
Do you understand? Its like the criteria and the fundamentals you have as a person determine if it "is" or "are".
FELIX: The criteria or the fundamentals as a person will affect the answer of this mathematical question.
Absolute mad lad.
(Italian speech)
FELIX: "I am the shape of Dark Souls...2?"
(starts off in Italian but then crazy yelling)
(chuckling and possible dying inside)
Who is this Italian animator that do... always do these amazing ones?
I want to know the source for this. Those are always great.
(crazy yelling)
Okay, lets look at the result.
Wow, it looks like I beat you again. How about that?

Glasweigan.

Ive seen this meme before but honestly Jack made it better. Well done. Can you believe disney posted this?
blatant
homophahhbiaah
Disgusting. What are they gonna do next? Fire Someone over some jokes?
pff
Butterfree : eee
Ash : butterfree
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Pokemon. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of strategic battle moves most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. Theres also Ashs optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the phrase "Gotta catch em all", for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the true intellectual of a nine year old to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that theyre not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Pokemon truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldnt appreciate, for instance,
the humour in Pikachus existential catchphrase "Pika Pika" which itself is a cryptic reference to Ashs battle with Brock in the Pewter Gym. Im smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Satoshi Tajiri genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
 
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Butterfree tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. Its for the ladies eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that theyre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
NO

Dammit stop it. Zoella is literally Brent. Brent from the office.
Who is this self loving and how do I call it, self loving and lacking of insight...
but still trying to act humble character and...
Lets just watch.
[Video]: "I dont think of myself as famous."
"I just have a lot of people who know who I am."
"The word famous just sounds really weird to me, because im just me, not..."
"Well, I was going to say,Im not really interesting, but obviously well six million people..."
"probably think I am."
Im not really that interesting but you know six million people probably think I am. I am pretty humble. But also...
So good. I love, I love her face as well. Its so perfect like
mmm
Im just gonna say Im not that, THAT interesting
Its kind of tiring all the time youtubers have to be so, uh, "No, its not that big a deal!"
You know what she has accomplished is pretty amazing.
And, she has every right to brag about it. I think its just uh,
those two sentences probably didnt work the best together and she probably sees that. But its still hilarious.
Next meme. Thats not the show Felix. Learn the rules. Check out my health bar. How is yours doing?
*salsa music by 4 year olds*
Cool Im rolling. Im rof-lmao-ing
Literally rof-lmao-ing at that one. That was too hard. Next clip!

Wow, this is really hard. What is his snow-SMR? That made someone grin someone lost a challenge in there at least.
[Video]: "We saw people in the streets ready to put 2018 in the rear view mirror and say hello to 2019!"
"We also saw this dog with a banana."
*inhale*
AhhhhHHHHH
Oh my god, is that a dog with a banana?
Thats so random!
-"2018 in the rear view mirror and say hello to 2019"-
"We also saw this dog with a banana."
God. Damn. I need to bind that to my soundboard. Dog with a banana
Thats so epic
Okay, who is it gonna be?

SKRRRRATTAR DU
I gotta be quiet guys...
Where am I?
Doko desuka?
*Swedish man who lives in the UK speaking Japanese*
That's right everyone
I am in Nippon
Did you guess it from my Neko headphones?
That's right
I'm somewhat of a Japaneseヽ(^◇^*)/
*whisper* I gotta be really quiet this time
The rule is simple
You laugh, You lose
And this time
Bringing new meaning to the game
Cause I dunno if my neighbours will be pissed off
So I'm trying to keep it down
It's aways so awkward recording in a new space
This is a new setup
It's a bit more iNtiMate, don't ya think?
Don't you like this?
Feels more special
The really hardest part of this challenge
Is the fact that I don't have any G-fuel
That's right, I forgot to pack it
How am I gonna get through this
Without G-fuel, this is impossible
I know
But we're going to have to do this together
We're on the same level now
Let's freaking do this
*gasp* NOOOooooooAHHHHHHHHHH
*gasp* NOOOooooOOOOooAHHHHHHHHHH
Oh God
I have already lost
Awwwww
Could this be the first time I ever lose
You laugh, You lose?
Oh my god
Oh my god
You know, maybe it's a nice place down there
*gasp* NOOOooooOOOOooAHHHHHHHHHH
[pewd's cute laugh]
It's a lake in berryessa
It's a reservoir for a dam
And the giant vortex is a drain
To prevent the dam from flooding
This is so sad
Can we got some Fs in the chats
And smash like on this video, if you...
Don't want ducks to go down giant vortexes
I expect this to get a billion likes
How do I make videos?
Someone remind me please
Your jokes have always been stale Felix
Nothing has changed
SKRRTFSFSFK (ew)
I'm close now
[incoherent grunts]
Oh god
I said oh god again
Same reactions just over and over
Now this is the kind of real enthusiasm
When I ask for a bro fist
Ha just kidding
You broke your screen for nothing *beeps*
How is your screen not broken yet?
Pound it real
For once
Oh god
Give me your hardest bro fist!
Damn that felt good
I'll buy you a new a new monitor Cyranek
I'm sorry
You got trolled Cyranek
Jesus christ
You knew it was coming
Is it still playing?
Poor monitor
NOOOOO
Don't do it!
Stop it!
You call that a bro fist Cyranek?
It should have at least gone to space
That wouldn't bro fist anyone
That was the weakest bro fist I've ever seen in my life
I'm not gonna buy you a new monitor
Cause it's clearly still working
Pathetic
Try harder next time

"Voltaire, John Locke, Calvin, and Hobbes, all sorts of people come in and they did Renaissance"
"Renaissance is basically the history version of feels versus reals, and reals won all the time, but then some"
"Philosophers in the 1800s decided feels were better than reals, which brings me to fucking Kant"
"Kant looked at all the people using reals and he wrote a big book called:"
"Im not listening because this hurts my feelings"
"He teamed up with Karl Marx Karl Marx was this guy who didnt feel like going to work on Monday"
"And he wrote a big book called:"
"I am lazy and the government should take care of me"
"these two lazy crybaby Manginas inspired a bunch of other crybaby"
"Manginas who set up the Frankfurt School who recruited their team of feminists,"
"communists, and people who care about black people, and sent them off to destroy all straight, white men"
"Friedrich Nietzsche saw this bullshit and debunked all their YouTube videos with real"
"atheism and science and then their videos like dislike ratio was terrible which"
"basically means none of their shit passed peer-review."
Thats true, thats true having a terrible like dislike ratio is the pinnacle of destruction youre done,
Youre done, mate. If he made sure they got that many dislikes,

"JUMP IN TO IT"
That's right kids, that's what we do for here on this channel. 
Has T series beat us yet?
First of all: round of applause 👏 👏
I thought it was the end game last week, but we're still in it and we're still kicking it!
Now, I'm a day ahead now - just a day ahead -
so it would be very awkward while I make this video very happy and very
cheerful, and then somehow t series has passed out of nowhere
I mean they'r- they're calling in the cavalry and all kinds of-
all these Indian celebrities going:
"Hey, I'm not paid to do this and I'm not paid to say this
but uH, subscribe to t-series
Oh and there's definitely NOT a gun to my head. But uh- subscribe to t-series."
Look at this:
"You can make India win"
I DON'T CARE!
They're calling the Indian celebrities!
P a t h e t i c
Ok? I barely relied on help from anYONE!

That is the system!
And Im sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system.
General Veers! You are too close to me.
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
What? That was well done!
General Veers! You are too close to me.
what i neve- im really confused. is that real? I dont think so.
That had absolutely nothing to do with sports
And they said: "What, you cant have this opinion? Its too conservative. Were not going to allow it."
I think thats a bad move
Im a First Amendment Absolutist
I believe in only two things completely: the First Amendment and boobs
PFFPHH
"You cant always trust boobs." - PewDiePie2017 Lets get real here, they push them up sometimes,and youre like
PFHH x3 Disappointment, you just set up for dis.. youre just setting them up for disappointment ladies
The first amendment and boobs
*TRIGGERED WHAMEN IS TRIGGERED*
I just want to make sure i heard you correctly as a woman anchoring the show.
You say.. what did you just say? You believe in the first amendment and
B double O BS? (B  O  O  B  S)
Boobs. Two things that have only known down in this entire countrys history the First Amendment and boobs
So those are the only 2 things i believe in absolutely in the country
Oh theyre so upset!
Blatant sexism. Comments about her appearance comments about
She wasnt commenting about you dickhead!
He said he believed in boobs oh no..
*offended whamen*:As a woman Im-Im...
How fragile can you be?
*HERE YOU SEE A TRIGGERED WHAMEN IN HER TRIGGERED STATE TRYING TO ARGUE ABOUT B O O B S
(INHALEEEEEEEE) She just doesnt-
Oh, thats beautiful
Shes rea- theyre reacting reacting like-
Hes saying "Im gonna kill you" or like
threatening her for her life
he just said he believes in boobs
as a meme
Ability to be able to comment on sports because of her gender and to say something like the only thing I believe in...
(TRIGGERED)Im Just- Im Still There Too, And I Just Wanna Make Sure Im Hearing You Correctly B-OO-ZE!? Or-
I just want to make sure I understand horrible words that came out of your mouth
on live television. Did you say B-O-C-C, or B-O-B?!
*guitar hero is lyf*
Okay all right, okay? Yeah, yeah, all right, okay? All right? What do we got?
(DIsneyland, land of fun times)

I hope I can help
Necromancy may be legal in Cyrodiil but few will openly admit to practicing it now that the mages guild has banned it
Farewell
May you rest in peace
Oh, yeah play video games
Watch someone else play video. Thats right. Im joining you guys
How stupid can you be
Come on, you guys have been doing it for years. Well, I cant do it oblivion is its my weakness
This game is just Gods gift to earth Thank You. Todd Howard son. Thank you. Fun fact ton Howard was in the Chess Club
Nothing cracks me up like this game. So
Lets just jump into it. The other one got deleted in case anyone is curious what happened to it
But we have a ton of new of Lybian memes. Thanks to bacon who apparently took it upon himself to single-handedly
resurrect this this game
Whats going on?
Stop you
Bow or serve your sentence your stolen goods are now forfeit
Then pay with your blood
Thats great
This game is too good. I never actually played this game. I just know I love it. Thats all
I know Todd Howard god bless your soul and they clearly were way too ambitious with this title
And thats what makes it so goddamn beautiful. I was writing games when I was you know, 12, whatever and
The other kids in the block would say, you know, Im gonna play quarterback for the Cowboys and Id be like
Im gonna make video games and everyones gonna play
You dork go back to the Chess Club
Whos laughing now?
Yes, I was in the Chess Club
Whos laughing now, I like how it goes from confident to insecure just like that whos laughing now?
Yeah
God bless you Todd, Im Rena brilliant. I love dogs doesnt everyone everyone does
How do you get that perfect timing god damn it only in Oblivion
I am ready burn it one thing. You need to know about me. I love dogs. Does it every
How does that happen what
in most games these days
Its all about you know
Duck and Cover and and wait for your enemy to come out and then, you know waiting for the right move
Its a lot of waiting is very boring but not nothing speaks like a real action movie nothing tops the matrix times a hundred
Thousand million like the Oblivion combat. Just why Brittani?
Youre pathetic
Take that
Goddamn it when you fail at the long range, you just gotta step in on that close range. Youre pathetic
Beautiful with that fire now aint it a surprise
No sign of them they do that in LA a lot it thats Skyrim to be fair, but they do that in life
Just kill someone immediately. Thats no sign of him. I guess hes gone
Oh
My god
Does everyone have a dislocated shoulder. What is going on? Wait, what the hell is this Oh,
Todd Howard seduces, you too, Matt. Theyre mad at Fleetwood Macs right? Its me
Bethesdas Todd Howard
look, I know you told me not to come around and
Know after we bought skyrim for the Xbox one. You said you were done
At least let me plead my case
No
Poor is the perfect game. Itll have no lobe time. Yeah, did you like that?
No, I cant Im sorry, Ill save this for later. Yes. Oh great and mighty grand champion. Is there something you need?
Can I carry your weapon shine your boots that road perhaps where its gonna shoot room in the air. Oh, is it the classic? Oh
Gee, you sure
Okay. Well, Ill be hanging around the arena grounds if you need someone to share the ground you walk on
Absolutely, beautiful. Absolutely
magnificent oh
my god
He just broke his back hes fine hes fine it happens all the time he does that all the time
Happening
This game is so confusing. I think thats why it makes it so good. You see someone run past just now
Well, if you do grab him and yell it bastard stole from me
Did you see thump is that how Americans try to do like Nordic accent is that is that how you see yes, huh?
Racism have you seen anyone in plain sight do you see that man right there?
You know the action is very exciting of in oblivion and Skyrim, of course
But nothing really entices me and immerses me like the dialogue that really makes me feel like Im part of the world
It feels like real dialogues real people real communication
How goes it?
Ive been better. I hope things get better. Oh
Hello
How are you today?
Ive been better. How about you?
Ive been better. Whats the news from the other parts of Tamriel?
nothing, and Id like to talk about
So long
Be seeing you at first. I thought it was the same guy. Just talking to himself
But its clearly the same voice actor for these two characters interacting. Ive been better. How are you been better?
Its as long as like this same person or something. Its incredible. I already show this one, but its so funny
This guys an absolute an absolute menace to society, I dont know you
Know its this about. I dont know you and I dont
They they test this game at all and I dont care
Okay, we get it thank you that is literally me at school to everyone
I dont know you I dont care to know you Thank You Pat sir. The voice acting is just impeccable lady. Amber
Knox has hired a new captain lady. Amber. Knox has hired a new captain of the guard
Todd did that intentionally
I know he did Spriggans natures Guardians my foot
Mean things theyll curse you or they might call a bear to tear you apart
Spriggans natures Guardians my foot mean things theyll curse you or they might call a bear to tear you apart
wow, its so nice to see a game that really
Articulates all the points that they want to say. It feels like Im talking to a real person
Dont you feel it too smash like if you feel it, too
thank you something thats really innovative for video games is the fact that
Characters will actually remember their interaction with you like that one Lord of the Rings game
For example, that definitely does not occur in oblivion
I mean oblivion really lives up to his name because it seems like a blue everyone just having amnesia
Im captain of the castle guard and Deon is captain of the town guard
Its simple I dont care what goes on in town. Thats Dions problem
Goodbye youre the gray fox
Youre under arrest for for for all kinds of stuff. Youre wanted dead or alive. Im im choosing dead
Ill make captain for this. Oh great
Man down he was just a captain that wanted to be captain. So sad only asking for enough to
Thank you later. Gather
Blessings of the shadow upon
Thank you, sir, sir get blessings of akatosh upon ye, thank you kind sir
Blessings of the shadow upon ye blessing upon you for smashing like on this video. Thank you. Cant there
He was here a second ago you
Ive seen your kind before youve got blood on your hands
Keep your blade sheath you murdering bastard, or Ill put you down myself
Stay safe citizen say saves our dark times
You just murdered some wine, how could you do this spell looks dangerous keep your distance
Damnit will we ever get games like this anymore? I doubt it your money or your money or your life
Youre smarter than you look seems fair they have braids in his hair
Take it its worthless to me anyway
The whole video of me just
Goddamnit, I laughed at that how does that happen?
You see this highwayman at existential crisis after you stole from him
You see he makes a living stealing from others and yet he himself was just robbed
You cant say you were in the wrong since hes done worse. I mean, yeah, I guess hes just calling us worthless
Isnt he because he was comparing our life to the money
Take it its worthless to me. Anyway. Yeah. Its oddly like sad
But of course the top of the cake the cake of the cake the cake inside the cake the guards, of course
Nothing beats the AI
Anyway, okay oblivion really has mastered AI it doesnt get any cleverer the cleverer really smarter than this. What is it?
Very subtle
Stop right there criminal scum
Nobody breaks the law and my watch Im confiscating your stolen goods now pay your fine or its off to jail
Then pay with your blood see my mascara watch out
Take the fuckin do well sir officer. She says all flesh and no fury. I cant tell you
It keeps stealing. So its a perfect long live the Empire whats going on?
Its all over law breaker your sprees at an inner Ill take any stolen. Could you have the next move is yours?
Pay your fine or Ill haul you away
Then pay with your blood
Its all over Anakin I have the high ground
Alright, thats it guys going right to subscribe to bacon. Ill link his channel down below
he is still uploading these I wouldnt be able to make this video without it and
Honestly, its so funny. I I its kind of weird
I I feel like I shouldnt play the game because I have this expectation in my head that every interaction is gonna be like this
Now because all Ive ever seen from it, but if you guys wanted me to play the game
I think I would be up for I think it could be fun
I dont know. But if you enjoyed this video smash like and Ill see you guys tomorrow. Hope this video. It was enjoyable
Im sure it was. Thank you very much. Goodbye

*Clip of professional Pewdiepie handshake with Conan plays.*
That was awful.
It turned into a high-five and it just fell apart.
It was...I never want to do that again.
*Laughs at himself*
But thats what makes me appreciate the cringe even more,
because I understand the cringe.
I bleed for the cringe.
So without further ado, lets go through some of my favorite cringe

55% of adults feel that women are most responsible for minor fender benders,
while 78% blame men for most fatal crashes.
please note that the percentages in these pie graphs do not add up to 100%
because the math was done by a woman

To other people reacting to original clips
How did we end up here? 2018
Lets begin with my man,
Markiplier
Now, hes been stealing my thumbnails for quite a while
Its kind of been bugging me a little bit
I didnt want to start any drama or anything like that
But you can clearly tell,
I dont know what quality Marks camera has
But it looks amazing
Game: I have a cigarette
Game: Yeah, sometimes I like to smoke down here-
This is exciting
Cos now its like a challenge, you know?
Im not a psychopathic person that needs a challenge for everything
Against another person, of course, but it is a challenge to myself
Then I always win
Game: -here
(Guy in video clip starts laughing)
Guy: Oh, that was a headshot
I guess this means Im winning. I didnt even- What happened?
Video: -cigarette? Yeah, sometimes I like to smoke down here
*Motorcycle headshots person in ally*
Mkay, that was pretty funny
Mark: Urgh
Mark: Ok, gotta replay on that one
Alright, a little pro tip for Mark here
This clip, I know, another company owns
So if Mark shows this clip,
that company is going to claim the revenue of this entire video
Which means, Mark, youre potentially losing 15,000 dollars on this video
So already I know Mark doesnt care about money
Which means Im not gonna watch his clips! Right?
Mark: Im dying
Mark: Im dying
Mark: IM DYING
So am I, but on the inside
Heh ha
Ok
Video: Stop!
Video: Youve violated the law. Pay the fine or serve your sentence!
Video: Your stolen goods are now forfeit

They look strangely similar, dont they?
Damn, what the hell!
Its like Asian and ginger Mark at the same shot!

*Clip plays epic battle music*
*Swedish chuckles*
Oh, I guess I lost
Come on!
Video: WHY! WONT! YOU! DIE!
Pewds: I guess we have different-
I guess we have different sense of humor
*Guy in video grunts as he gets punched*
It looks like Mark is cracking
Oh, theyre so good
This guy makes legendary Skyrim parodies, theyre so funny
Mark: Ha hu, I havent seen that one before, that was-
Ive seen it and its hilarious!
Mark!
What are you doing, Mark!
Alright, 1:1, me versus Mark
Baaah
I cant let Mark win!
Video: Fine, just think of how delicious youre gonna be
Video: Youre gonna make  a great s a n d w i c h D:
Video: In fact, they named you after your eventual fate
Video: Tho we cant have the girl die, so well have the pig dies (n O)
Video: Why is that guy still wearing a plastic bag on his head
*Guy in video starts laughing hysterically*
Mark, whats wrong with you? How can you laugh at this?
This is, so sad (AlExA PlAy DeSpAcITo)
No
No ones talking to you :(
*Guy in video continues laughing*
Minecraft girl: See? Ham feel-
Mark: Hrg, Its fine
Ok, 2:1, Mark
Oh this is great. This is also owned by another company!
Mark! Do you hate money?
You know what? Just ask me!
Ok? Just ask me before the video
And Ill make sure youll cut anything that you dont need
You clearly have room to cut it
And then just give the money to me!
Silly Mark, cares more about good content than making revenue
What is this?
Star Wars dub by Japanese-
Mark: Oh no
Mark: Its gonna be horrifically racist
Google Translate: its Oova anakeen

Mark: Hahahaha
Its stopped being funny after a while
Google translate: U ve ah da chozen one
Google Translate: hito wasu saigyo zaku to yu goludu desutoroishisu notto joinzemi
Google Translate: guringu baransu za forsu zoto leavu ito inda

Mark: Yeah it is
Mark: Yeah, its a-
*weird music starts to play* (o-o)
Mark: huuuuUUh? O-O
That was it? Aw, cringe, man. (True)
Ive seen this as well. Owned by another company. Dont even-
Like, even if I show you the still frame, they would claim the video (Damn copywright ;( )
Thats how insane the YouTube system is right now (Smh)
Im gonna take this as I won against you, Mark (Sure you did Pewds, sure)
Mark, if you wanna do a You Laugh You Lose
Uh, its probably not enough content actually, but uh
See if you can beat me on another one (Probably easy)
So, feel free to
Feel free to do that
And check out Mark for more You Laugh You Lose videos (Theyre funny)
