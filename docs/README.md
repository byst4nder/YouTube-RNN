# YouTube RNN (Recurrent Nerual Network) #
## WIP ##

The RNN is designed to produce new transcripts for YouTube videos.
It takes a text file of a collection of videos as a dataset and tries to output similar videos/

### Example Dataset ###
The current example dataset is way too small making the model very unpredictable.
The transcripts come from Felix's (Pewdiepie's) YLYL videos (Only about 50 of them).
Downloads to larger datasets will be available soon.
A tutorial to make your own datasets will be available soon.
